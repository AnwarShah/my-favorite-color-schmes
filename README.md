# my-favorite-color-schmes

My collection of color schemes for various text-editors.
These are not created by me. Credit goes to authors of the
schemes.

## Sublime
Sublime schemas can reside in `~/.config/sublime-text-3/Packages`.
Copy them under a folder for convenience. I use `Selected` as folder name.
